# OpenWrt for the Xiaomi Mi Router AX3000T (RD03v2)

Pure, mainline-based **OpenWrt** for the **Xiaomi AX3000T**, hardware revision **RD03v2** (Qualcomm IPQ5018). Replaces Xiaomi's locked "MiWiFi/XiaoQiang" stock firmware with software you fully control — installed **permanently to NAND**, booting on its own with no serial cable after the first flash.

**Status — everything works:**

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| SoC bring-up (IPQ5018, kernel 6.12) | ✅ |
| Boots from NAND, unattended, persistent config | ✅ |
| Airoha **AN8855** 2.5 GbE switch (4× LAN) | ✅ |
| Wired LAN data path | ✅ |
| WiFi **2.4 GHz** (IPQ5018) | ✅ |
| WiFi **5 GHz** (QCN6122) | ✅ |
| In-place updates via `sysupgrade` | ✅ |

> Built against **OpenWrt `25ee126`** (Jul 2026 snapshot, kernel 6.12.94).

## ⚠️ Read this first

- **This is for the `RD03v2` hardware revision only** (IPQ5018 + AN8855 switch + QCN6122 5 GHz). Check the sticker/board. Other AX3000T revisions (e.g. the MT7981 "RD23" variant) are **completely different hardware** — this will brick them.
- **You need a USB↔UART (3.3 V) serial adapter** and to solder/attach to the board's UART pads for the *initial* install. After OpenWrt is on NAND, updates need no serial.
- **There is real brick risk.** Flashing NAND on a locked-bootloader device can go wrong. Every step here is recoverable via the stock TFTP recovery (below), but **do this at your own risk.** We are not responsible for bricked routers.
- The stock console is **read-only** and the bootloader ignores keypresses by default — this guide shows how to get around that.

## Credits

This port stands on the shoulders of prior work:

- **[csharper2005](https://github.com/csharper2005/openwrt)** — the **Airoha AN8855 DSA switch driver**, the base device tree, and the `qca-nss-dp` phy-less-2500 fix. Without this, the 2.5 GbE switch (the hard part of this SoC) wouldn't work. The DTS and driver here are their work.
- **[OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/)** — the `qualcommax/ipq50xx` target and everything underneath.

**What this repo adds on top** (the pieces that were missing to make it a *usable, installable* router):
1. **NAND install + boot integration** — wiring the device into `platform.sh` so `sysupgrade` actually writes to flash *and* sets the U-Boot boot-flags that make the stock bootloader boot OpenWrt instead of stock.
2. **The WiFi fix** — the ath11k firmware↔board-data version match that stops the Q6 co-processor crashing (both radios).
3. Per-board caldata extraction, the 2.4 GHz radio enablement, and this end-to-end install guide.

The goal is to feed this **upstream to OpenWrt**. If you can help clean it up for a PR, please do.

## Quick start (flash the prebuilt image)

Prebuilt images are on the [Releases](../../releases) page:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `…-initramfs-uImage.itb` | Boots OpenWrt entirely in RAM (used during install; never touches flash) |
| `…-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin` | The permanent image, written to NAND by `sysupgrade` |
| `…-squashfs-factory.ubi` | Alternative factory image (whole-UBI) |

The install is a **UART + TFTP** procedure because the stock bootloader is locked. Full walkthrough below.

## Installation guide

### 0. What you need
- The router, an RD03v2.
- A **3.3 V USB-UART adapter** wired to the board UART: **TX↔RX, RX↔TX, GND↔GND** (leave VCC unconnected), **115200 8N1**.
- A Linux PC with an Ethernet port, `dnsmasq` (or any TFTP server), and a serial terminal (`screen`, `picocom`, …).
- The **stock `recovery.bin`** for the RD03v2 (a full stock image — used to re-enable the bootloader console). *We don't redistribute Xiaomi firmware; obtain the matching stock image for your unit.*
- The three OpenWrt images from Releases.

### 1. Serial + TFTP setup
Connect UART. On the PC, put your wired NIC on `192.168.31.100/24` and run a TFTP/DHCP server serving a directory that contains `recovery.bin` and the OpenWrt `…initramfs-uImage.itb` (renamed e.g. `owrt.itb`). Example with dnsmasq:

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.31.100/24 dev eth0
sudo dnsmasq --interface=eth0 --bind-dynamic --no-daemon \
  --dhcp-range=192.168.31.20,192.168.31.200,5m \
  --dhcp-boot=recovery.bin,,192.168.31.100 --dhcp-option=66,192.168.31.100 \
  --enable-tftp --tftp-root=/path/to/tftp --tftp-no-blocksize --port=0
```
Open the serial console: `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`.

### 2. Re-enable the bootloader console (TFTP recovery)
The stock U-Boot ignores keypresses (`boot_wait=off`). A stock **TFTP recovery** turns it back on:
1. Power off the router.
2. Hold the **reset** button and, while holding, plug power in. Keep holding ~8–10 s until the LED **blinks**, then release.
3. It DHCPs, pulls `recovery.bin`, verifies + reflashes stock (~2–3 min on the console), and halts. This sets `boot_wait=on`.

### 3. Boot OpenWrt in RAM
Power-cycle (no reset). Now the bootloader pauses. **Interrupt it** (spam Enter as it boots) to reach the `IPQ5018#` prompt, then:
```
setenv boot_wait on
setenv bootdelay 5
saveenv
setenv ipaddr 192.168.31.1
setenv serverip 192.168.31.100
tftpboot 0x44000000 owrt.itb
bootm 0x44000000
```
OpenWrt boots from RAM. Nothing has been written to flash yet — if anything looks wrong, just power-cycle back to stock.

### 4. Flash to NAND
On the RAM OpenWrt (root shell on serial, or SSH to `192.168.1.1` once you bring up the LAN), copy the `…squashfs-sysupgrade.bin` onto the device (scp/wget over the LAN), then:
```sh
sysupgrade -n /tmp/openwrt-…-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin
```
Our `platform.sh` case wipes the UBI, writes kernel+rootfs, **and sets the U-Boot boot-flags** (`flag_try_sys{1,2}_failed=8`, etc.) so the stock bootloader boots our slot. It reboots into OpenWrt **from NAND**. Done — the serial cable is no longer required.

### 5. First boot
- LAN is `192.168.1.1`. Ports `lan2/lan3/lan4` bridge into `br-lan`; the `wan` port is the AN8855's WAN.
- **Set a root password** (`passwd`) and configure WiFi (LuCI or `uci`). By default the WiFi vifs are created **disabled** — enable them with `uci set wireless.default_radio{0,1}.disabled=0; uci commit wireless; wifi`.

### Recovering / going back to stock
Repeat the **TFTP recovery** (step 2) with the stock `recovery.bin` — it reflashes stock over everything.

## Building from source

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd openwrt-xiaomi-ax3000t-rd03v2
./build.sh          # clones OpenWrt @ 25ee126, applies files/, builds
```
Or manually: check out OpenWrt at `25ee126`, copy `files/*` over it, `./scripts/feeds update -a && ./scripts/feeds install -a`, seed `.config` with the device + `CONFIG_TARGET_ROOTFS_INITRAMFS=y`, then `make defconfig && make -j$(nproc)`. Images land in `bin/targets/qualcommax/ipq50xx/`.

See [`MANIFEST.txt`](MANIFEST.txt) for every file and what it does.

## How it works (the interesting bits)

**The 2.5 G switch.** The AN8855 hangs off GMAC1 over a 2.5 G SerDes link with no PHY — which made `qca-nss-dp` abort probe (`swphy: unknown speed`). csharper2005's driver + nss-dp patch fix the phy-less 2500 CPU port; the switch then comes up as a normal DSA switch (`lan2/lan3/lan4/wan`).

**Making the locked bootloader boot OpenWrt.** Xiaomi's U-Boot boots by an A/B "try/fail" flag scheme and loads the kernel from a specific UBI volume. A naive `sysupgrade` fails (`Can't open device for writing`) and even a successful write wouldn't boot (the bootloader keeps loading the stock kernel). The fix is the `platform.sh` case for our board: it sets `CI_KERN_UBIPART`/`CI_ROOT_UBIPART`, and writes `fw_setenv` boot-flags (`flag_try_sys{1,2}_failed=8`, `flag_boot_rootfs=0`, `uart_en=1`, `boot_wait=on`) that force the bootloader onto our slot — mirroring the proven `xiaomi_ax6000`/`redmi-ax5400` path.

**The WiFi crash.** With correct board data the Q6 firmware still crashed: `phyrf_bdf.c … ANTENNACHAIN_AXIS_Z … zero`. The board data wasn't wrong — it was a **version mismatch**: OpenWrt ships ath11k firmware `WLAN.HK.2.7.0.1`, but the stock board-data (`bdwlan`) is built for `2.5.r4`. Downgrading the firmware to 2.5 fails too (too old for the 6.12 driver → `err_smem_ver`). The fix keeps the 2.7 firmware and uses **2.7-compatible board data**: for 2.4 GHz, the `board-id 255` entry from ath11k-firmware's own `IPQ5018/hw1.0/board-2.bin` (which is byte-identical to its `board-id 0x24` entry — i.e. the AX3000T's own board data, just in 2.7 format); for 5 GHz, a working QCN6122 device's 2.7 board data. Per-unit calibration still comes from the board's own `0:ART` partition at runtime.

**Memory (256 MB is tight).** After the SoC reserves ~76 MB for the WiFi co-processor and bootloader, Linux sees ~180 MB — and the two ath11k radios alone hold ~85–90 MB of *unswappable* kernel memory (firmware allocated from host DDR). That left only ~15–20 MB free, and under load the kernel OOM-killer would shoot `hostapd`/`netifd`, dropping WiFi. Two mitigations, both in this port: (1) `qcom,ath11k-fw-memory-mode = <2>` (vs the usual `<1>`) tells the radio firmware to request less RAM — modest (~7 MB) but free, and proven on other dual-radio IPQ5018 boards; (2) **`zram-swap`** (compressed in-RAM swap) is shipped and enabled by default, giving userspace daemons somewhere to go under pressure. Tested: an 80 MB memory-pressure spike that previously guaranteed an OOM now produces **zero OOM kills** — zram absorbs it and both radios stay up.

## Known limitations

- **5 GHz board data is a compatible stand-in** (from another QCN6122 device) re-keyed for our board, not the AX3000T's own 2.7 board data (which doesn't exist upstream). 5 GHz works; antenna/TX-power tuning may be imperfect. If you can produce a proper 2.7 QCN6122 BDF for this board, please contribute it.
- Front LEDs (PWM) aren't wired up yet.
- This is a snapshot build; treat as beta.

## Contributing / upstreaming

PRs welcome — especially help getting this **upstream into OpenWrt** and improving the 5 GHz board data. The AN8855 driver is separately on its way to mainline via csharper2005 and the Airoha/MediaTek DSA work.
